## A Friendly Timer To Help You Work Efficiently

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique created to make you do breaks regularly during work sessinos.

How it works is rather simple:
1. Work for 25 Minutes
2. Take a break for 5 Minutes
3. Go back to Step 1

(The original method includes longer breaks after 4 working cycles but we discard that for this website)

# Functionalities

As a small project, it won't have too much going on, but I will try to have those things:
- Of course, a functional Pomodoro timer cycling through Work/Break time every 25/5 minutes (Completed)
- A sound when the timer switch from one mode to another so that you won't forget about it (Completed)
- The hability to change the duration of work and break time (Completed)
- Have custom user times saved locally (Uhhh...)
- Have a nice timer design (I have one specific idea that may require approximately 247,000 lines of CSS/JS)
- Maybe other things I haven't thought about for now
